# Node RESTful APIs Larning
Repo for running through node rest api tutorial [Build Node.js RESTful APIs in 10 Minutes](https://www.codementor.io/olatundegaruba/nodejs-restful-apis-in-10-minutes-q0sgsfhbd) by Olatunde Garuba.

Might play around with some other things in this repo (maybe even make a script to automate this process or some part of it?).
